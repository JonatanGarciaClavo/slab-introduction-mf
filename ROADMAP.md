# Roadmap

This file contains all the different steps we will do during the workshop. So you have kind of log of what we did and in which order.


1. MF demo: we will create in `home` Header and Footer components and we will see how to share those with `pdp`

2. Why MF? we will see different MF approaches showing the possible MF [architecture](./architecture.dio) options.

3. Server setup: we will create a nestjs server to create API for our store **products**.

4. Create `auth` MF to handle authentication part.

5. Create **cart** API in the server.

6. Create `cart` MF to deal with the different cart components.

7. Create `addtocart` MF, in this case it will be Vue project that we will create just the add to cart button, so we can see how to use different frameworks.

8. Add routing to the host app aka `home`.

9. How to test MF? Unit tests and E2E.

10. Final thoughts and questions.
